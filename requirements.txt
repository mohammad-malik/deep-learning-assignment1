# TensorFlow (cross-platform CPU/GPU) - uncomment and pick this if you don't need Apple Silicon native builds
# tensorflow>=2.12.0

# --- Apple Silicon (macOS M1/M2) instructions ---
# On Apple Silicon (M1/M2) it's recommended to use the native builds:
# 1) Install the macOS TensorFlow package and the Metal plugin for GPU acceleration:
#    pip install --upgrade pip
#    pip install tensorflow-macos
#    pip install tensorflow-metal
# 2) Optionally pin versions that are known to work for your setup.
# Add these two packages to your environment instead of the plain `tensorflow` package.

# If you want to pin the Apple Silicon packages in this file, uncomment the lines below:
tensorflow-macos
tensorflow-metal

# Optional but recommended
tensorflow-addons>=0.21.0

# For progress bars and nicer notebook experience
tqdm>=4.65.0

# Reproducibility helpers (optional)
python-dateutil>=2.8.2

# Development / testing (optional)
ipython
jupyter

# Notes:
# - If you plan to use a GPU, install a TensorFlow package compatible with your CUDA/cuDNN.
# - To install: pip install -r requirements.txt
